# UTC_Demographics_Map
The goal of this project was to create a static map showing the spatial relationship between urban tree cover and Black population in Washington, DC. The data is organized by Census Tract, and both UTC data and demographic Data are from 2020. I began this project on 4/20/2024 and finished it 4/21/2024.
